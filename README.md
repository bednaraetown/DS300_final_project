# DS300_final_project
I was able to work on a project focused on the predictive modeling of video game sale success. Using a public dataset of Steam games from Kaggle my partner and I used the libraries of NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow inside of Python to clean, visualize, and make predictions on the data. After preparing the data we, using a multitude of features, tested multiple different models to predict game sales accuracy. Our conclusion came from the Scikit GaussianNB model yielding a 94% model accuracy. The shortcomings were evident in the individual class accuracies as the accuracy for the majority class was 97% but the minority class was only 49% accurate. Our future improvements for this project would be to look into why this is happening and how we can raise the minority class prediction accuracy.
